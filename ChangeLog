	* Makefile:
	* xcompmgr.c: (root_tile), (main):
	Track changes to _XROOTPMAP_ID property

2003-11-09  Keith Packard  <keithp@keithp.com>

	* xcompmgr.c: (time_in_millis), (main):
	Add a bit of scheduling to updates; update every 30 ms
	instead of waiting for more events.  Smooths out window moving.
	Interval needs to be configurable probably.

	* xcompmgr.c: (root_tile):
	Make sure _XROOTPMAP_ID property is right type, format and length
	before attempting to use the resulting value.

	* xcompmgr.c: (configure_win):
	Configure damage must include shadow region, not just window.
	Also, leaking region on each configure.

	* xcompmgr.c: (main):
	oops.  Left in an XSynchronize call.
