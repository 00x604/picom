	* xcompmgr.c: (sum_gaussian), (make_shadow), (root_tile),
	(paint_all), (map_win), (unmap_win), (determine_mode),
	(configure_win), (circulate_win), (main):
	Track whether cliplists have changed and avoid computation when not.
	Shrink shadows.
	Speed up shadow construction a bit by using memset.
	Eliminate useless INTERVAL code.
	Use XSync after paint_all to gather more events per update.

	* xcompmgr.c: (map_win), (unmap_win), (get_trans_prop),
	(determine_mode), (add_win), (main):
	Add support for CM_TRANSLUCENT property.

	(add_win), (restack_win), (configure_win), (circulate_win),
	(destroy_win), (ev_serial), (ev_name), (ev_window), (main):
	
	Rename gussianMap to gaussianMap (who the heck is gus?)
	Allow for other names for the root pixmap
	Handle non-zero border widths better (need Composite change
	to display them though).
	Add MONITOR_UPDATE mode that eliminates double buffering and
	blanks the screen to make sequence of update operations visible.
	Leave damage object around to catch map damage right.
	Add CirculateNotify support.

	* xcompmgr.c: Eliminate several compiler warnings: missing
	includes, static functions, unused variables.  Remove confusing
	informational messages with the word "error" in them.

2003-11-14  Keith Packard  <keithp@keithp.com>

	* xcompmgr.c: (main):
	Eliminate all delays in updates; let the X server scheduling
	handle things.

2003-11-13  Keith Packard  <keithp@keithp.com>

	* xcompmgr.c:
	Reduce scheduling latency to 10ms

	* xcompmgr.c: (make_gaussian_map), (sum_gaussian), (make_shadow),
	(shadow_picture), (paint_all), (main):
	Use an alpha map instead of an ARGB picture for shadows.
	Update last_update only when actually updating windows.

2003-11-11  Keith Packard  <keithp@keithp.com>

	* xcompmgr.c: (win_extents), (paint_all), (add_win), (main):
	Detect ARGB windows, don't give them shadows, compose them
	correctly.

	* Makefile:
	* xcompmgr.c: (root_tile), (main):
	Track changes to _XROOTPMAP_ID property

2003-11-09  Keith Packard  <keithp@keithp.com>

	* xcompmgr.c: (time_in_millis), (main):
	Add a bit of scheduling to updates; update every 30 ms
	instead of waiting for more events.  Smooths out window moving.
	Interval needs to be configurable probably.

2003-11-09  Keith Packard  <keithp@keithp.com>

	* xcompmgr.c: (root_tile):
	Make sure _XROOTPMAP_ID property is right type, format and length
	before attempting to use the resulting value.

2003-11-09  Keith Packard  <keithp@keithp.com>

	* xcompmgr.c: (configure_win):
	Configure damage must include shadow region, not just window.
	Also, leaking region on each configure.

	* xcompmgr.c: (main):
	oops.  Left in an XSynchronize call.
